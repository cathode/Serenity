NSynth - A Non-Linear Media Graph System

1. Overview

NSynth provides a system for serving frames in a non-linear editing environment,
using a graph of connected actions.

1.1 Actions and Scripts

A script in NSynth is a heirarchial graph of actions, combined with some other
data about the script itself.

Each action in the script takes input of some type from another action and acts
upon it in some way. The action system can be extended, but the built-in types
of actions are Source, Transform, and Output.

1.1.1 Source Action

A Source action takes a non-frame input and generates a frame from it. The most
common example of a Source action is one that reads it's frames from a media 
file on disk, but other types of Source actions may be defined.

1.1.2 Transform Action

A Transform action takes a frame input, and performs an operation on the frame.
The new frame is then passed on to the next action in the graph. Common types
of Transform actions include operations like resizing, cropping, and cleanup,
but other types of Transform actions maybe defined.

1.1.3 Output Action

An Output action allows the frames resulting from the processing of the script
to be utilized. An Output action could dump the processed frames to a file,
pipe the output to another application, or allow programmatic access.
